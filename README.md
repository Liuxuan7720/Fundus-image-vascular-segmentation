# Fundus-image-vascular-segmentation
# Intelligent Fundus Vessel Segmentation with Deep Learning. If a doctor wants to diagnose whether there is a disease in the eye, the blood vessels in the eye is a very important indicator, if the blood vessels are observed with the naked eye is very time-consuming and labour-intensive, through this intelligent blood vessel image segmentation model, the blood vessels in the fundus can be segmented out. After running, first a model training is performed, and after the training is completed, the model is obtained, which can segment the fundus blood vessel image intelligently.
